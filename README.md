# simulation
This repository contains Python simulation code for BPSG width optimization.
FullSimulation.py produces a number of plots and saves them \
Optimizer.py produces only a single plot showing the efficiency vs the width of BPSG. It can handle multiple layers and accounts for self-shielding \
BPSGvsB203.py compares BPSG and B203 results, once they have been produced by FullSimulation.py \
